That's why languages like Java have begun to lose popularity, they take object orientation too far.  \n",

It's that there are libraries and packages for doing anything you might like!\n",

Also consider that their names maybe be changed, so the inheritance structure isn't clear all the way up (and maybe that's a good thing).
